    "CISC : The main idea behind CISC processors is that a single instruction can be used to do all of the loading, evaluating and storing operations.

It’s not necessarily about having fewer instructions, it’s more about how those instructions are used. That reduces the number of cycles per instruction but comes at the cost of increasing the number of instructions per program such as Apple Silicon & ARM.\n",
